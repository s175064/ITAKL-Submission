This repository contains all analysis code, preprocessing scripts, and figure-generation workflows used in the manuscript:
“Region-Specific Multimodal Brain Imaging Correlates of Repetitive Head Impact Exposure in Adolescent American Football Players.”
The goal of this project is to reproducibly process multimodal MRI data, compute head-impact exposure metrics, and perform voxelwise
statistical analyses linking RWE-Lin to changes in mean diffusivity (MD) and resting-state fMRI power spectral density (fMRI-PSD).
